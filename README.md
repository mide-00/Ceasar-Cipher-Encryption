# Ceasar-Cipher-Encryption

This project is a message encryption/decryption project built using python. 

The inspiration comes from Julius Ceasar back when he needed to send secure military messages to his generals.

To begin you choose if you want to encode a message or decode a message and then enter the shift number.
The shift number tells the program how many spaces in the alphabet to move either forward to backward. whatever alphabet at that position is returned until the entire text/message is completely encoded or decoded.

Give it a try and see for yourself.!!
